# Python-project
# This project involves web-scraping the average housing prices from 50 Chinese cities in 2023 from Anjuke (a website documenting Chinese cities' housing prices).
# Also, this project involves a simple descriptive analysis and drawing a simple boxplot for the web-scraped dataset.
# The file and data are my own work, please do not distribute them.
